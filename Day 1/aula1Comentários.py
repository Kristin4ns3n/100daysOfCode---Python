#Comentário padrão do python 

#print()
#Exibe alguma informação na tela. 
#Exibe um output

#O pyhton não tem comentário multi-linha /*  */
#Comments are descriptions that help programmers better understand the intent 
#and functionality of the program. They are completely ignored by the Python interpreter.

'''What the hell is a DocString '''
'''If we do not assign strings to any variable, they act as comments.'''

'''This is not a comment '''
"""This is also not a comment """

""" You are kidding me! This actually works """

""" Althought the python interpreter actually reads the comment,
but because the quotation mark are not after a string function, method or class, they are used to document the code"""
